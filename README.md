# LinkedList

LinkedList class written in C++

A project was created during the course of programming.

The goal was to implement LinkedList and as additional task was to create a dictionary which can load words, sort them and correct mistakes using Levenshtein distance.

Project is compiled with **Visual Studio**.

### Commands to control the dictionary:

- **quit** - exits the program
- **help** - should show the help menu, but forgot to implement
- **size** - shows size of the current dictionary
- **show** - shows words in the dictionary(might take a while on a big dictionary)
- **clear** - clears the dictionary
- **sort** - sorts the dictionary using bubble sort =D
- **sorted** or **s?** - shows if the dictionary is sorted
- **sortload** - loads words from the text file and sorts them immediately
- **load** - loads words from the text file without duplicates
- **rawload** - loads words from the text file including duplicates
- **save** - saves current dictionary
- **fixfile** - fixes the typing errors of the words in the file and produces file with fixes
- **push** - pushes new word into the dictionary
- **fix** - finds the right spelling of the word
- **find** or **search** - finds the word in the dictionary

This project was just to acknowledge strong and weak sides of LinkedList structure.

In conclusion, LinkedList is not very great for sorting.
